# LoCo - A LoRa-concentrator

An Opensource LoRa Concentrator/Gateway using SX1301/SX1308 and SX1255/SX1257 For RRI and RPI Zero.

This project is heavyly inspired and adapted from @will127534 works he has done for his contribution at https://github.com/will127534/LoRa-concentrator.

We just want to take this project ahead and updating it with most commonly avialibility of componenets.

The first step is to port the schematic to KiCad to make the process of devlopment easier as an opensource project.
